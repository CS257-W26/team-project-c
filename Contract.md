# Communication and Decision Making
* We will communicate mainly over sms whenever needed (ideally daily). We will also use some Google Docs on a shared drive to keep track of to-dos, problems, etc
* Team members who are having trouble communicating are expected to explain themselves. If this problem persists, we will reassess communication standards during our weekly meeting.
* We will use Google services, sms, and email to communicate.
* Decisions will be made by a majority vote.
* For satisfactory participation, team members must complete their tasks promptly. We all have lives, so we will not use specific deadlines (besides the deadlines of the curriculum)

# Conflict resolution
* For someone who is struggling to complete their work, we will implement a three-strike system. Both the first 2 strikes are a verbal warning. If the issue continues, then we will have a meeting with Anya.
* Conflicts will be resolved by the following process:
  - If the conflict can be solved by a vote, we will use that to decide.
  - If the conflict cannot be resolved by a vote, the third team member will act as a mediator and attempt to improve the situation.
  - If this fails or the conflict involves all three team members, then we will seek help elsewhere. A meeting with Anya, for example.
