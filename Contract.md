# Communication
Team members must notify the group when starting or finishing a task. For example, “I finished drawing a picture, and I will merge it later today.” For new tasks that need to be completed, they may be added to a to-dos google doc that we made. We will google drive as well as git hub in combination with text group chat to support team communication and work.

If communication is difficult for a team member, we will ask them is there is anything we can do to make it easier, and we will always be able to touch base in class.

# Conflict resolution
Decision-making will involve a discussion about potential issues, then having a vote. The majority decides. When the minority is adamant on an issue or feature, then we will discuss after it is implemented to reassess.
